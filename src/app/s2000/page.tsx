Produced from 1999 to 2009, it remains one of the most celebrated driver-focused sports cars. With a lightweight chassis, rear-wheel drive, and a 50:50 weight distribution, the S2000 delivers an exhilarating open-top driving experience, making it a favorite among enthusiasts.",

      header: "Exterior",
      body: "The S2000 features a sleek, aerodynamic design with a long hood and short rear deck, giving it a classic roadster look. Sharp body lines, flared fenders, and a low stance enhance both its aesthetics and performance. The power-operated soft-top folds away seamlessly, while later models (AP2) feature subtle design refinements like updated bumpers and taillights.",

The naturally aspirated 2.0L/2.2L inline-four produces 237-247 horsepower, paired with a precise 6-speed manual transmission. A limited-slip differential, double-wishbone suspension, and razor-sharp steering provide incredible handling, making it one of the most engaging rear-wheel-drive sports cars ever built.",

A digital instrument cluster, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and supportive bucket seats put the driver at the center of the experience. The short-throw shifter is one of the best in the industry, offering snappy, precise gear changes. Later models added refinements like improved seats and softer suspension, but the S2000 always stayed true to its performance-first philosophy.",
